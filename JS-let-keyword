let Keyword:
The let keyword was introduced in ES6(2015).

    - Variables defined wit let cannot be redeclared.
    - Variables defined wit let must be redeclared before use.
    - Variables defined with let have block scope.

Cannot be Redeclared : - Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.
let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0; // cannot be done.

Block Scope: - Before ES6 (2015), Global Scope and Function Scope. - ES6 introduced two important new Javascript keywords : let and const. - These two keywords provide Block Scope in Javascript. - Variables declared inside a {} block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

Example :
{
let x = 2;
}

// x cannot be used here

    - Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have block scope.

Redeclaring Variables: - Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems. - Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block.

var x = 10;
// Here x = 10;

{
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

Here x is 2

Redeclaring : - Redeclaring a javascript variable wih var is allowed anywhere in a program.

    - with let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed.

let x = 3;

{
let x = 2; // Allowed
let x = 3; // Not allowed
}

{
let x = 2;
var x = 3;
}
