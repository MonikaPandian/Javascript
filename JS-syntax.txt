Javascript syntax is the set of rules, how Javascript programs are constructed:

creating variables:
var x;
var y;

Using variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

Javascript Values :
    - The Javascript syntax defines two types of values:
     - Fixed values
     - Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.

Javascript Literals :
    The most important syntax rules for fixed values are: 

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:
    10.76
    1001

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
    "John Doe"
    'John Doe'

Javascript Variables:
    - In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
    - Javascript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

Javascript Operators: 
    - Arithmetic operators (+ - * /)
    (5 + 6) * 10

    - Assignment Operators (=)
    let x;
    x = 5;   

Javascript Expressions :
    - An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

Javascript Comments :
    - Not all Javascript statements are "executed".
    - Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
    - Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

let x = 5; // I will be executed
// x = 6; I will NOT be executed

Javascript Identifiers / Names :
    - Identifiers are Javascript Names.
        - A letter (A-Z or a-z)
        - A dollar sign ($)
        - Or an underscore(_)

Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

JavaScript is Case Sensitive:
    - All Javascript identifiers are case sensitive.
    - The variables a and A are two different variables.

    let a , A;

JavaScript and Camel Case:
    Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

    Hyphens:
    last-name, last-name
    Hyphens are not allowed in Javascript. They are reserved for subtractions.

    Underscore:
    first_name, last_name

    Upper Camel Case(Pascal Case):
    FirstName, LastName
    
    Lower Camel Case:
    firstName, lastName


JavaScript Character Set :
    - JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
    - Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
